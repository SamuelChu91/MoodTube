* * Errors will render for incorrect or incomplete user input!
MoodTube also provides a demo  
account for guests to test the functionality of the app.

* ### Videos!

* * Of course the bulk of both Youtube and Moodtube is spent displaying and watching videos!  

* #### Video Home Page

* * The home page provides a header for the User to navigate around the app.  

* * The header will scroll with the user as the user scrolls down.

* * * Search Bar

* * Search functionality will be fully fleshed out in the near future!

* * * MoodTube Logo

* * The MoodTube logo provides the user with the ability to navigate to the home page from any page with a header.

* * * Video Index

* * The user has access to many videos which have had an impact on my life in some way.

* * Videos are first displayed in rows under certain categories. The categories and videso are then displayed vertically to mimic the youtube format. Clicking on a video sends you to that video's show page.

* * Recommended videos specific to user queries will be done in the slightly longer future!

* * * Video Show Page

* * Comments and autoplay functionality to be implemented soon!
