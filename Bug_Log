Lengthy Bugs :
1. Heroku won't push (application error), localhost:3000 worked
    - attr_reader :password //// colon was on attr_reader and not password (user model)

2. Text from VideoIndex not rendering, not receiving sessionReducer/userReducer
    - root_reducer had the other reducers under combineReducer but I never imported the reducers

3. Handlesubmit wouldn't take input
    - was routing to my presentational components, should go to containers
    - because they provide our store with the props through connect, presentational is just html
    
4. My log out button was never turning into a sign in button
    - In my sessionReducer my default state was user: null, however when a user is logged in
    - my session points to an id with information so state.session.id wasn't
    - recogned by my presentational header component, which was what my container component
    - was passing in

5. Errors were displaying and persisting on multiple pages
    - Needed to clear errors, solved by creating action and passing it into our
    - reducer and using componentwillunmount to call action

6. Dropdown menu only closed inside header_nav
    - Only the local state in header nav had access
    - Used onBlur so when button isn't the focus we 'closemenu'
    - Hacky fix, used setTimeout so that clicking inside the menu
    - still let me use 'logout', otherwise dropdown closed because
    - button wasn't recognized

7. Videos weren't showing up, 500 error
    - Not all my videos had pics attached, was checking for attachments because
    - my json view was looking for attachments, incorrect syntax passed into my from
    - had to attach pics to all my sseded vids, then save! them
    - didn't interpolate correcly in my video item form



Common Bugs :
1. Don't put debugger in return objects =(
2. Check your imports are spelled correctly and taken from the right path
