Lengthy Bugs :
1. Heroku won't push (application error), localhost:3000 worked
    - attr_reader :password //// colon was on attr_reader and not password (user model)

2. Text from VideoIndex not rendering, not receiving sessionReducer/userReducer
    - root_reducer had the other reducers under combineReducer but I never imported the reducers

3. Handlesubmit wouldn't take input
    - was routing to my presentational components, should go to containers
    - because they provide our store with the props through connect, presentational is just html
